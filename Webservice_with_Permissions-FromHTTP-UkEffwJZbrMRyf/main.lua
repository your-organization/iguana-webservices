-- Consider if you want to use Iguana to act as a corporate webservice to serve up data
-- to various people in your company.

-- We can leverage the user permission system built into Iguana to do that. Because people
-- have different roles it's nice to be able to serve up different available webservices based
-- on their role.  Also some webservice queries might serve up different data depending on
-- the role of the user.

-- We can power this off Iguana's built in user permission system by leveraging the group
-- feature. Different requests can be mapped to different functions for different groups.

-- This channel shows how this can be done using the iguana.action and iguana.user modules. 
-- It also makes use of the basic authentication to do the authentication.
